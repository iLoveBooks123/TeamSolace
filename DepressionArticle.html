            Depression is a mental health condition that affects how a person feels, thinks, and lives daily life. It is more than just feeling sad for a few days. When someone has depression, the sadness lasts a long time and makes it hard to focus in school, enjoy hobbies, or even get out of bed. Common signs include feeling empty or hopeless, losing interest in things you used to enjoy, sleeping too much or too little, feeling tired all the time.  and having trouble focusingIn serious cases, people may even think about self-harm turing int suicide as their last resort. If these feelings last for more than two weeks, it might be depression, not just regular stress.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The good news is, depression can be treated. The first step is to talk to someone you trust, like a parent, teacher, or counselor. You can also speak with a therapist, who can help you understand your feelings and teach you ways to cope. Some people may also get medicine from a doctor if needed. Taking care of yourself also helps getting enough sleep, eating better, exercising, spending time outside, and staying around supportive people can slowly improve your mood. Even small steps like going for a walk, talking to a friend, or doing a hobby you like can help over time.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            If you notice a friend struggling, you can help by listening, checking in on them, and encouraging them to get help. Depression is tough, but it is treatable. With support and time, people can feel better again. Asking for help is a brave and important first step.
