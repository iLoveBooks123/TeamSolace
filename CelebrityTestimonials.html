            The conversation surrounding mental health has been profoundly shaped by high-profile celebrities who have chosen to share their struggles, using their massive platforms to destigmatize seeking help and encourage self-compassion. For a generation that often equates fame with flawless happiness, these admissions offer a vital reminder that mental health challenges are universal, regardless of wealth or success.

        <h2>Billie Eilish</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Since her debut, Billie Eilish has been a leading voice in mental health awareness, using her experimental music and honest interviews to discuss her struggles with depression and body dysmorphia. She has shared that depression has profoundly influenced her life, a feeling reflected in powerful songs like "What Was I Made For." Eilish continues to speak candidly about the difficulties of extreme fame, noting the constant loss of privacy often leads to feelings of "impending-doom" and requires a difficult process of letting go.

        <h2>Selena Gomez</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Selena Gomez has dedicated a major part of her career to mental health advocacy, moving beyond personal disclosure to establish platforms and funds. She has been very open about her own journey, including her bipolar diagnosis. In 2021, she co-founded Wondermind to offer community and educational resources, and her Rare Impact Fund aims to raise $100 million for mental health services. Her 2022 documentary, Selena Gomez: My Mind and Me, emphasizes her deep, ongoing commitment to this cause, underscoring that even she does not "feel good all the time."

        <h2>Justin Bieber</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Justin Bieber consistently champions the importance of mental health hygiene, having made the tough choice to cancel his Justice World Tour to prioritize his need for rest and recovery after health issues took a toll. He has spoken frankly about experiencing deep depression during his earlier tours and his past reliance on prescription drugs like Xanax, which he used out of shame to create a "screen" between himself and his actions. Now, having found greater stability, he is committed to focusing on his internal well-being.

        <h2>Ariana Grande</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Ariana Grande credits therapy and music with helping her navigate severe trauma and grief following the 2017 Manchester bombing and the death of her ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller. She dealt with intense PTSD, anxiety, and depression during the creation of her albums Sweetener and Thank U, Next. Grande revealed that while she took professional treatment seriously, having music as a "part of that remedy was absolutely contributing to saving my life," highlighting its essential role in her survival and recovery.
