                No matter how different all our lives are, we all have experienced stress - but what are some different types of stress? How do we deal with stress? Stress can be both positive, which is called eustress, and negative, deemed as distress. Positive stress motivates us - like when you start studying because you remembered your math test tomorrow. Negative stress discourages us - like when you feel defeated after seeing your math study guide and panicking because you have no idea where to start. How we react to stress depends on how we appraise an event; if we see it as important, we may overreact, and if we see it as unimportant, we may underreact.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                In the past year, 74% of people have felt so stressed that they have been too overwhelmed or unable to cope. Of those 74%, 46% reported that they ate too much or ate too little due to stress. Although some stress is positive, being in a constant state of stress can make our bodies more prone to sickness. Think about how your throat closes up when you're about to cry, or when your blood pressure rises when you're angry. Our actions, such as procrastinating responsibilities or not taking care of ourselves, can inflict negative stress, leading to health issues. During stressful situations, the body releases hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones help us react quickly in dangerous or demanding moments. However, when stress continues for a long time, these hormones remain active, which can interfere with how the brain controls mood, emotions, and sleep. As a result, a person might start to feel constantly worried, tense, or overwhelmed which are signs of anxiety.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8">Mitigating Stress</h2>
    
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                But how can we mitigate the negative effects of stress so you don't end up like this? In order to alleviate stress, research has shown that the key to nurturing your body is by keeping an overall healthy lifestyle, such as eating well, sleeping well, having good time management, etc. Adults who sleep fewer than 6 hours are 30% more likely to face high stress than those who get 7 to 9 hours, and regular exercise can cut stress by up to 40%. Stress often piles up from small tasks we ignore, so get ahead of time! Overall, make sure you feel refreshed in the morning and ready to wake up the FIRST time your alarm goes off.
